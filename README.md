# TubeViz 📊

A data visualization project that analyzes and visualizes statistics of the most subscribed YouTube channels using Python and Plotly Express.

## Overview

TubeViz provides interactive visualizations of YouTube channel statistics, including subscriber counts, video views, categories, and channel start dates. The project uses a dataset containing information about the top 302 most subscribed YouTube channels.

## Features

- 📈 Interactive histograms showing subscriber distribution
- 🥧 Pie charts displaying category breakdown of top channels
- 📦 Box plots analyzing channel creation dates
- 🔍 Clean data processing and visualization
- 📱 Interactive plots powered by Plotly Express

## Dataset

The dataset (`most_subscribed_youtube_channels.csv`) includes information about:
- Channel rank
- Channel name
- Subscriber count
- Video view count
- Video count
- Channel category
- Channel start year

## Requirements
